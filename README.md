# Facial-Recognition-based-Attendacne-System-using-Opencv
Facial Recognition based Attendance System using OpenCV in Python

This project was created as part of my college curriculum

Language used: Python 3.7
Modules used:
csv,
tkinter,
PIL,
mysql.connector,
cv2,
os,
numpy,
time,
datetime

The main motive behind developing this system isto help save time and energy of the lecturers by avoiding the conventional method of roll calls to mark the attendance and give them more time for teaching. This system does not in any way scrutinize the conventional attendance taking method used by educational institutes but tries to implement a system that will make the overall process error & stress free for the staff involved in the process.

The following project comprises the following parts:-


1)Register Student:-The first step will be to register the student so that he/she can be
recognized by the system. This page will contain the fields such as Name, ID, Department,
class roll no., Division of the student as so on. These details will be stored in a database
securely.

2)Data set collection: - In this step, we will be capturing the student's faces using a
good quality webcam and store the images in the Dataset folder. In this step,
various positions of the student's face are captured.

3)Training the dataset:- After the creation of the dataset, we will then be training
the dataset to classify & recognize the students. The dataset will be trained and
stored in a (.XML) file extension.

4)Storing attendance in a database- This is the final step of the project wherein the
student's attendance is marked and stored in a database & Excel file after the face
of the student is recognized.
